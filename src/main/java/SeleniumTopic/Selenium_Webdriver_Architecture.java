    /**
     Selenium and Selenium Webdriver are used interchangeably because Selenium Webdriver is the most used one.
     Selenium webdriver is used for creating browser-based tests like regression, smoke, or functional automation tests.

     Earlier Selenium was communicating with the browser using JSON Wire protocol but with the latest Selenium 4
     selenium completely moved into W3C(World Wide Web Consortium) Wedbriver Protocol, so Selenium now controls browsers natively.
