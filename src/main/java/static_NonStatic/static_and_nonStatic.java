    /**
     Q1: What is a static variable and how is it used in your code?
     Answer:
     A static variable is shared by all objects of the class.
     In my code, StaticVariable = 20 is static, so every object will use the same value.
     It saves memory and is used when the value should be common.


     Q2: What is the difference between static and non-static variables?
     Answer:
     Static variable: Belongs to the class and shared by all objects.
     Non-static (instance) variable: Each object has its own copy.

     static int StaticVariable = 20;  // shared
     int instance = 10;     // unique to each object

     Q3: Can we call a static method from a non-static method?
     Answer:
     Yes, directly.
     In my code, inside nonStaticMethod(), I call method(), which is static.

     Q4: Can we call a non-static method from a static method?
     Answer:
     Yes, but only using an object.
     In myMethod(String test), I created an object obj1 to call obj1.nonStaticMethod();.

     Q5: Why is the main method static in Java?
     Answer:Because the JVM calls main() without creating an object. Static allows it to run first.

     Q6 :What happens if you try to access a non-static variable inside a static method directly?
     Answer:
     You will get a compile-time error.
     In a static method, you need an object to access non-static variables.

     Q7: Is it possible to override static methods?
     Answer:
     No. Static methods belong to the class, not objects, so they cannot be overridden,
     only hidden (if redefined in child class).

     Q8 :What is Method Hiding?
     When a child class defines a static method with the same name and signature as a static method in the parent class
     , it is called method hiding â€” not overriding.
