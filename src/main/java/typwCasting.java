     * What is Typecasting explain with small code snippet?
      Typecasting is converting data from one data type to another data type.
      Typecasting can be applied to both primitive and non-primitive types.
      Typecasting process doesn't alter the data but alters the type.

     Implicit casting: This is known as automatic typecasting. Usually,
     this happens when you converting a lower data type to a higher data type
